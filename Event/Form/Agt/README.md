"Sec" - means a Section.  

1. Suggested Subcategories

A Section is comprised of a Title and the text of the Section.  We abbreviate these as "sec" for the text, "Ti" for the title (works in English, German, French and other languages), and "Sec" for the section with title.

Sections have many possible variations, including subsections, lead-in and lead -out paragraphs, numbering and the like.
