"Form" - is intended to be any presentation of a document or part.  Roughly speaking anything that might be an Agreement, Terms of Use, Statment of Work, Term Sheet, Receipt or the like.  Anything formatted for human consumption.  

We start from the observation that the most widely used format for presentation is the web and that the mostly widely used syntax is HTML.  HTML is ubiquitous, has a standards process and is very stable with respect to the matters that concern our simple uses.
